# Data-Science-Lab
1) AI Agents :- All CrewAI Agents that I have created as a part of learning to build AI Agents.
2) Agentic Project :- A RAG Project for test case generator.
3) Core Concepts :- Python Core Concepts related to AI implemened on Jupyter Notebook. Blogs are posted on hashnode. Link is pasted at the end of this Readme file.
4) Practice Lab 1 :- For the introductory purpose, make a machine learning model which is supposed to predict who survived during the titanic shipwreck.
5) Lab 1 :- Build your first Neural Network to predict house prices with Keras.
6) Lab 2 :- The EMNIST dataset is a set of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19 and converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the MNIST dataset. Use Tensorflow to predict the pixelated alphabet and show its accuracy.
7) Lab 3 :- Implement basic logic gates using Hebbnet neural networks.
8) Lab 4 :- Implement Zipf's Law of Length, Law of Meanings and Heap Law.
9) Lab 5 :- Text classification for Sentimental analysis using KNN. Note: Use twitter data.
10) Lab 6 :- Case Study :- Sentiment Analysis via Reviews
