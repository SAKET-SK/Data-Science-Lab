1) Practice Lab 1 :- For the introductory purpose, make a machine learning model which is supposed to predict who survived during the titanic shipwreck.
2) Lab 1 :- Build your first Neural Network to predict house prices with Keras.
3) Lab 2 :- The EMNIST dataset is a set of handwritten character digits derived from the NIST Special Database 19 and converted to a 28x28 pixel image format and dataset structure that directly matches the MNIST dataset. Use Tensorflow to predict the pixelated alphabet and show its accuracy.
4) Lab 3 :- Implement basic logic gates using Hebbnet neural networks.
5) Lab 4 :- Implement Zipf's Law of Length, Law of Meanings and Heap Law.
6) Lab 5 :- Text classification for Sentimental analysis using KNN. Note: Use twitter data.
7) Lab 6 :- Case Study :- Sentiment Analysis via Reviews
