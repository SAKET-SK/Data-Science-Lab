**[Scene: Two friends, *Alex* and *Jamie*, are sprawled on a couch, controllers in hand, arguing over a gaming magazine.]**  

**Alex:** (flipping pages excitedly) Dude, Fall 2025—GTA 6 is *finally* happening! Pre-orders start in September.  

**Jamie:** (grabbing the magazine) Wait, we’re going back to Vice City? *And* swamps? Hope we get to wrestle alligators while dodging the cops.  

**Alex:** (laughs) Oh, you *will*! Lucia and Jason—first female lead, by the way—better watch out for those AI cops. Rumor says they’re psychic now.  

**Jamie:** (mock-serious) Great. So if I sneeze during a heist, they’ll trace my DNA?  

**Alex:** (grinning) Maybe! But hey, underwater exploration! And the map’s so big, you’ll need a virtual GPS to find your own car.  

**Jamie:** (raising an eyebrow) You *still* lose your car in GTA 5.  

**Alex:** (ignoring him) Plus, VR! Imagine robbing a bank in PSVR2 and *literally* sweating bullets.  

**Jamie:** (snorts) Yeah, until your mom walks in mid-heist and you scream.  

**Alex:** (pointing at the page) Oh-ho! Tommy Vercetti *might* be back. Bet he’s running a shady tiki bar now.  

**Jamie:** (grinning) Classic. And they’re already planning a cyberpunk DLC? Rockstar’s just printing money at this point.  

**Alex:** (leaning back) Best part? No more hackers ruining GTA Online—well, *maybe*. They’re beta-testing anti-cheat like crazy.  

**Jamie:** (deadpan) So… see you in 2026 when it’s actually playable?  

**Alex:** (laughing) Worth the wait. Now pass the chips—I need fuel for my hype train.  

**[They fist-bump as the screen fades to a GTA 6 teaser trailer.]**  

**THE END.**
