            "We believe the bullish momentum will continue after the price breaches above the upper boundary of Donchian channel at 263.33. This level can be used as an entry point for placing a pending order to buy. The stop loss can be placed below 247.52. After placing the order, the stop loss is to be moved every day to the next fractal low indicator, following Parabolic signals. Thus, we are changing the expected profit/loss ratio to the breakeven point. If the price meets the stop loss level (247.52) without reaching the order (263.33), we recommend cancelling the order: the market has undergone internal changes which were not taken into account.Fundamental Analysis of - Sales of Tesla’s China-made electric vehicles fell over 10% from a year earlier in September. Will the Tesla stock price continue rebounding?Tesla sold 74,073 China-made electric vehicles in September - a 10.9% decrease from a year earlier, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) data. Sales of China-made Model 3 and Model Y cars were down 12.0% from a month earlier. The EV leader unveiled a restyled Model 3 in September with a starting price in China 12% higher than the previous model, and would start delivering in the fourth quarter. However its Chinese rival Xpeng also launched a revamped G9 SUV to sell 15% lower than the previous model. Rising competition and declining sales trend are bearish for a company’s stock price. However, the current setup is bullish for TSLA stock price.\n",

Backtested performance is not an indicator of future actual results. The results reflect performance of a strategy not historically offered to investors and does not represent returns that any investor actually attained. Backtested results are calculated by the retroactive application of a model constructed on the basis of historical data and based on assumptions integral to the model which may or may not be testable and are subject to losses. General assumptions include: XYZ firm would have been able to purchase the securities recommended by the model and the markets were sufficiently liquid to permit all trading. Changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the backtested returns presented. Certain assumptions have been made for modeling purposes and are unlikely to be realized. No representations and warranties are made as to the reasonableness of the assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Backtested performance is developed with the benefit of hindsight and has inherent limitations. Specifically, backtested results do not reflect actual trading or the effect of material economic and market factors on the decision-making process. Since trades have not actually been executed, results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity, and may not reflect the impact that certain economic or market factors may have had on the decision-making process. Further, backtesting allows the security selection methodology to be adjusted until past returns are maximized. Actual performance may differ significantly from backtested performance. Backtested results are adjusted to reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income and, except where otherwise indicated, are presented gross-of fees and do not include the effect of backtested transaction costs, management fees, performance fees or expenses, if applicable. Please note all regulatory considerations regarding the presentation of fees must be taken into account. No cash balance or cash flow is included in the calculation.\n",

            " Pegged by many as a high-risk, high-reward stock, Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA) ranks among the most interesting public companies in the world. Founder Elon Musk is a controversial superstar in the technology industry, and Tesla's Silicon Valley roots have boosted investor expectations. Tesla attracted even more attention in 2021 when the company reached a trillion-dollar market cap–a stratospheric valuation that had only been reached by a handful of megatitans.\n",
            " The future of Tesla has exciting potential but remains difficult to predict. TSLA investors should temper their expectations and consider how the potential risks that Tesla may face over the next five to ten years.\n",
            "Key Takeaways\n",
            "The electric vehicle (EV) maker, Tesla, has a number of key risks that it will face in the next 5-10 years.\n",
            " Notable risks include Tesla cars being too expensive with tax breaks and that the construction of its Gigafactory (battery factory) taking longer than expected. \n",
            "More broadly speaking, Tesla faces a competitive environment from both legacy automakers and other EV manufacturers.\n",
            "Tesla's future success will depend heavily on ramping up manufacturing capacity and infrastructure.\n",
            "The Tesla brand is closely associated with Elon Musk, a CEO whose visionary ambitions are matched by his propensity for scandal.\n",
            " 1. Tesla Cars Are Still Too Expensive Even with generous government incentives, such as tax breaks for alternative technology, potential consumers of Tesla's Model S are still faced with a large price tag that starts at $94,990 before any incentives or discounts, as of November 2021. Even Tesla's new lower-cost option, Model 3, is $43,990 before tax incentives and gas savings, as of May 2021—which is still out of reach for most drivers.\n",
            " The cars are not only expensive for consumers to purchase, but they're also costly for Tesla to make. Vertical Group analyst Gordon Johnson estimated that the company lost roughly $14,000 on each of the Model 3 vehicles it sold in 2018, although these figures may improve as the company scales up.\n",
            " 2. Tesla Could Run Out of Batteries One of the early problems Tesla executives ran into was a lack of batteries to power their products. Tesla's world-renowned Gigafactory, which is still under construction in Sparks, Nev., is supposed to solve the company's battery crisis. The lithium-ion manufacturing plant, with a planned footprint of more than 1.9 million square feet, projects to help ramp production to more than 500,000 Tesla cars annually.\n",
            " Major projects such as the Gigafactory are often plagued with logistical or regulatory hurdles, and it remains to be seen if the factory can be completed on time. The Nevada government has given the green light to the Gigafactory, which is expected to produce $100 billion in additional economic activity over the subsequent decades.\n",
            " Although the facility is only 30% complete, one gigafactory may not be enough, and Musk has hinted that the company may need several such facilities to meet demand. It is going to take an incredible amount of capital expenditures (CapEx) to keep the company fully charged and shareholders happy.\n",
            "Tesla was the largest manufacturer of plug-in electric vehicles, with 14.55% of all worldwide sales in the first half of 2021. The next largest manufacturer was VW Group, with 12.52%.\n",
            " 3. Low Gas Prices When gas prices tumbled in 2014 and 2015, Tesla lost some of its luster. After all, gasoline-powered cars compete with Tesla's products, and declining gas prices make gasoline-powered cars more economically attractive. Gas prices do not have to remain at decade lows to damage TSLA stock prices; it just has to be cheap enough to keep legacy cars on the road.\n",
            " TSLA's gas quandary comes from two angles at once. The first problem is increased global production in oil; the once-dominant \"peak oil\" theory seems to be debunked, with global oil production increasing every year from 2009 through 2019. Oil companies are getting better at finding oil and, with the help of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, they are also more effective at extracting oil.\n",
            " Petroleum supplies are increasing and, at the same time, internal combustion engines are more fuel-efficient. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average fuel efficiency of light-duty passenger cars in the U.S. continues to improve.\n",
            " If Tesla is going to transition into a mainstream auto manufacturer and generate consistent cash flow, it needs to sell a lot more cars. Consumers are less likely to transition to electric cars if petroleum-based fuels remain a far cheaper alternative.\n",
            " 4. Increased Electric Vehicle Competition Tesla is not the first company to create electric cars. Interestingly, the first electric automobiles were probably created as early as 1834 by Thomas Davenport, but Tesla seems to be the most successful, thus far.\n",
            " Two notable competitors, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Nissan Leaf, failed to gain early traction because of high retail prices and limited driving range. The Nissan Leaf starts at $27,400 before incentives, with a range of up to 226 miles, as of October 2021.\n",
            " The 2022 model of the Chevrolet Bolt, starting at $31,000 before incentives, with a range of 259 miles, offers more than the 220-mile range of Tesla's standard Model 3, as of October of 2021. Other companies plan to enter the electric car market in the next few years, including Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Subaru, Ford, and BMW. If this happens, then Tesla's market share may start to get crowded.\n",
            " Some tech companies may also join the fray; Apple, Inc. believes it can challenge Tesla in the transportation industry, and Google has also placed bets on the auto industry. Tesla is admittedly concerned about businesses with broader existing consumer bases. \n",
            " 5. Tesla May Never Recoup Massive Expenditures Musk once famously noted about his company, \"We are going to spend staggering amounts of money on CapEx.\" Lots of investors like to see high capital expenditures, but there has to be a payoff on the other end. This seems particularly true in an infant industry paved with failed startups.\n",
            " Tesla has already spent billions on development for the Model 3 and Model X cars, and the battery factory comes with its own hefty price tag. In an SEC filing for the first quarter of 2021, Tesla estimated that capital expenditures would likely ramp up to $4.5 or even $6 billion per year.\n",
            "$6 Billion\n",
            "According to SEC filings, Tesla may spend as much as six billion per year on capital expenditures in the coming years.\n",
            " 6. A Controversial, Part-Time CEO The same quarterly filing included a note about Tesla's reliance on Elon Musk. Tesla is \"highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer,\" the company said.\n",
            " This is not particularly shocking, especially in the technology sector; think of Steve Jobs and Apple. Perhaps more concerning is what follows shortly after: \"he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.\"\n",
            " Musk is a very active executive. He was once CEO of PayPal before joining Tesla and has since become CEO and Chief Technical Officer (CTO) of Space Exploration Technologies. He is also Chair of SolarCity, which installs expensive solar equipment. The loss of a key executive could be a substantial setback for the company.\n",
            " Moreover, the eccentric CEO has proved a lightning rod for scandal, as might be expected from a self-appointed \"Technoking.\" The same quarterly filing notes that there are now nine pending class-action lawsuits against Tesla and Musk, relating to a 2018 tweet in which Musk falsely announced plans to take the company private. The tweet is alleged to have been an effort to manipulate TSLA's share price, a violation of federal securities laws.\n",
            " Musk's impulsive behavior also has real-world consequences. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Musk repeatedly aired misinformation about the pandemic and criticized lockdown restrictions as \"fascist\" in an earnings call with Tesla investors. He later defied public health authorities by reopening Tesla's Bay Area plant, causing a cluster of 450 infections.\n",
            " The Bottom Line With a trillion-dollar valuation, Tesla's success as an electric vehicle manufacturer is hard to dispute. However, there are still many potential hurdles to overcome, from the difficulty of developing affordable EV technology to the risks posed by competing firms.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Market Risk**: \n",
            "   - TSLA is subject to significant market fluctuations influenced by broader economic conditions, interest rates, and investor sentiment. The stock has a high beta of 2.34, indicating it is more volatile than the market, which poses risks during downturns.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Liquidity Risk**: \n",
            "   - While TSLA has a reasonable liquidity profile, it remains exposed to liquidity risks, especially during turbulent market conditions. The current ratio is 2.03, indicating sufficient short-term assets to cover liabilities. However, sudden market shifts could impact liquidity.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Regulatory Risk**: \n",
            "   - Tesla faces risks from regulatory changes in the automotive and energy sectors, including emissions standards and incentives for electric vehicles (EVs). Changes in government policy could affect demand and operational costs.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Competitive Risk**: \n",
            "   - The EV market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional automakers entering the space. Tesla may face challenges in maintaining its market share against established competitors and new entrants.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Operational Risks**: \n",
            "   - Tesla's reliance on Gigafactories for battery production presents operational risks. Delays or failures in production could hinder growth and profitability.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Leadership Risk**: \n",
            "   - The company's future is closely tied to CEO Elon Musk, whose controversial behavior and potential distractions could impact the company's strategic direction and stock performance.\n",

            "\n",
            "- **Scenario Analysis**:\n",
            "  1. **Market Downturn**: If the overall market declines by 20%, TSLA could drop by 30% or more, given its volatility.\n",
            "  2. **Regulatory Changes**: A significant reduction in EV subsidies or stricter regulations could reduce TSLA’s sales by 15%, resulting in a projected earnings decline of 25%.\n",
            "  3. **Increased Competition**: If competitors capture 10% of TSLA's market share, the company may experience a 20% drop in revenue over the next two years.\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Stress Test Results**:\n",
            "  - Assuming a worst-case drop in stock price to $250 (a 29% decrease from the current price of $353.34), the portfolio impact would be significant, particularly for investors with medium risk tolerance.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Mitigation Strategies\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Diversification**: \n",
            "   - Investors should diversify their portfolios by including stocks from various sectors to mitigate the risk associated with TSLA's high volatility.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Hedging**: \n",
            "   - Consider using options strategies, such as buying put options on TSLA stock, to protect against downside risk.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Setting Stop-Loss Orders**: \n",
            "   - Implement stop-loss orders around $247.52 to automatically sell shares if the price falls to that level, limiting potential losses.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Monitoring Market Conditions**: \n",
            "   - Stay informed about market trends, regulatory updates, and competitive landscape changes to react swiftly to any adverse developments.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Investment Horizon**: \n",
            "   - Align investment strategies with long-term growth potential, as short-term fluctuations may not reflect the company's true value.\n",
            "\n",

            "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a probe into 2.6 million Tesla (TSLA) vehicles over its \"Actually Smart Summon\" feature, following four reported crashes. The feature, introduced in September, allows users to remotely control their vehicles using smartphone app. Preliminary findings indicate that the vehicles failed to detect obstacles like posts and parked cars, leaving users with insufficient time to prevent accidents. This investigation follows an October probe into Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software involving 2.4 million vehicles.The investigation covers Tesla's Model S, Model X, Model 3, and Model Y vehicles from 2016 through 2025 equipped with the optional FSD system. NHTSA's evaluation will assess the feature's maximum speed, functionality on public roads, and potential connectivity delays. Reports suggest that the feature’s shortcomings have led to collisions, such as a Model 3 striking a parked car in Houston in 2023. Tesla’s stock fell 4% in midday trading following the announcement, reflecting investor concerns over the heightened scrutiny of its driver assistance systems.Market Overview:\n",
            "NHTSA investigates Tesla's \"Actually Smart Summon\" feature after four crashes.Probe affects 2.6 million Tesla vehicles with optional Full Self-Driving (FSD).Tesla’s stock declined 4% amid concerns about regulatory and reputational risks.Key Points:Feature reportedly fails to detect obstacles, leaving users with insufficient reaction time.Preliminary evaluation could lead to recalls if issues are confirmed.Investigation follows Tesla’s December recall of over two million vehicles for Autopilot issues.Looking Ahead:NHTSA’s findings may impact Tesla’s self-driving technology rollout and future recalls.Increased scrutiny could delay Tesla’s pivot towards robotaxis and advanced automation.Market reaction will hinge on Tesla’s ability to address safety concerns effectively.Bull Case:Tesla’s proactive engagement with NHTSA could demonstrate its commitment to safety, potentially mitigating reputational damage and regulatory risks.The investigation highlights Tesla’s innovation in self-driving technology, reinforcing its leadership in the autonomous vehicle space despite challenges.Addressing the reported issues with \"Actually Smart Summon\" could lead to improved features, enhancing customer trust and satisfaction.Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance systems, including Full Self-Driving (FSD), remain a key differentiator, positioning the company for long-term growth in automation and robotaxis.Investor concerns may be short-lived if Tesla effectively resolves the probe, paving the way for continued advancements in autonomous technology.Bear Case:The NHTSA investigation adds to existing scrutiny of Tesla’s self-driving systems, potentially leading to costly recalls and further regulatory challenges.Reports of crashes involving \"Actually Smart Summon\" raise concerns about the reliability of Tesla’s autonomous features, impacting consumer confidence.Heightened regulatory oversight could delay Tesla’s rollout of robotaxis and other advanced automation initiatives, affecting its growth trajectory.Tesla’s stock decline of 4% reflects market skepticism about its ability to address safety concerns effectively, which may weigh on investor sentiment in the near term.Repeated issues with driver-assistance systems could open the door for competitors to gain market share in the autonomous vehicle sector.Tesla's \"Actually Smart Summon\" probe highlights the challenges of balancing innovation with safety in the rapidly evolving self-driving technology space. The feature's reported shortcomings could pose significant reputational and regulatory risks as NHTSA evaluates whether a recall is warranted. CEO Elon Musk, a close adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, may face additional pressure to ensure Tesla's advanced driver-assistance systems meet federal standards.As Tesla seeks to expand its dominance in autonomous technology and robotaxis, this probe underscores the importance of robust safety measures in maintaining consumer trust and regulatory compliance. The outcome of the investigation will likely influence Tesla’s long-term strategy and the broader trajectory of self-driving innovation.This article was originally published on Quiver News, read the full story.\n",
